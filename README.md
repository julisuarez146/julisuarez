# Who I am?
# Hi everyone, I'm Juliana Suarez  

🎓 I am currently completing my studies to obtain my degree in Computer Science 💻. 
📚 I am in my third year of college where I am working on obtaining a 2-year degree in Mathematics. 

Some languages ​​I'm familiar with: Java, C++, Python. 
I still consider myself a beginner in computing, something I've really enjoyed is creating games in C++, such as mazes or obstacle course challenges.

## 🌱 A little about me

- 🥾 Hiking and exploring new places
- 🏊‍♀️ Swimming
- ✈️ Traveling with friends or family
- 👨‍👩‍👧 Spending time with family
- 🍽️ Trying new restaurants
- 🌄 Enjoying beautiful landscapes, sunsets, and views
